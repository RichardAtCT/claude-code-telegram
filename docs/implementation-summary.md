## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Set up project structure (TODO-1)
2. ✅ Implement configuration system (TODO-2)
3. ✅ Build security framework (TODO-3)

### Phase 2: Core Bot (Week 2) ✅ COMPLETED
4. ✅ Create Telegram bot core (TODO-4)
5. ✅ Integrate Claude Code (TODO-5)

### Phase 3: Features (Week 3) ✅ COMPLETED
6. ✅ Implement storage layer (TODO-6)
7. ⏳ Add advanced features (TODO-7)

### Phase 4: Production (Week 4) ⏳ PENDING
8. ⏳ Complete testing suite (TODO-8)
9. ⏳ Prepare deployment (TODO-9)

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Async/await throughout** for scalability
- **Repository pattern** for data access
- **Dependency injection** for testability
- **Middleware pipeline** for cross-cutting concerns

### Security
- **Defense in depth** with multiple security layers
- **Principle of least privilege** for file access
- **Rate limiting** at multiple levels
- **Comprehensive audit logging**

### Quality
- **Type hints** everywhere
- **>80% test coverage** requirement
- **Automated linting and formatting**
- **Continuous integration** from day one

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Security Priorities
1. **Always validate paths** - Never trust user input for file paths
2. **Enforce rate limits** - Prevent abuse and cost overruns
3. **Audit everything** - Log all security-relevant operations
4. **Sanitize inputs** - Prevent command injection

### Performance Considerations
1. **Stream Claude responses** - Don't wait for complete output
2. **Use connection pooling** - For database efficiency
3. **Implement caching** - For frequently accessed data
4. **Set resource limits** - Prevent memory/CPU exhaustion

### User Experience
1. **Provide progress feedback** - Show typing indicators
2. **Format code properly** - Use Telegram's markdown
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - User-friendly error messages
4. **Offer suggestions** - Context-aware quick actions

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components ✅
- **Project Structure**: Full directory layout, dependencies, logging
- **Configuration System**: Environment-based config with validation
- **Security Framework**: Authentication, rate limiting, path validation, audit logging
- **Telegram Bot Core**: Command handlers, message routing, inline keyboards, response formatting
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite with good coverage
- **42 Python files** implemented across all core modules

### Recently Completed ✅
- **Claude Code Integration**: Subprocess management, session handling, output parsing, tool monitoring
- **Storage Layer**: SQLite database, repositories, analytics, persistent sessions (TODO-6)

### Next Steps ⏳
- Add advanced features (TODO-7)
- Complete testing and deployment (TODO-8, TODO-9)

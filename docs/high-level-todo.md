## Implementation Status & Order

1. ✅ **TODO-1**: Project foundation established
2. ✅ **TODO-2 & TODO-3**: Core infrastructure completed
3. ✅ **TODO-4**: Bot functionality implemented
4. ✅ **TODO-5**: Claude integration completed
5. ✅ **TODO-6**: Persistence layer completed
6. 🔄 **TODO-7**: Advanced features (current focus)
7. ⏳ **TODO-8**: Ensure quality
8. ⏳ **TODO-9**: Prepare for release

## Current Focus: TODO-7 Implementation

**What's been completed:**
- 48+ Python files across all core modules
- Full bot infrastructure with handlers and middleware
- Comprehensive security and configuration frameworks
- Complete Claude Code integration with subprocess management
- SQLite storage layer with repositories and analytics
- Session persistence and cost tracking
- Testing infrastructure with 188 passing tests

**Current task:**
- Implementing advanced features (file uploads, Git integration)
- Building quick actions system and session export
- Adding image/screenshot support
- Enhancing user experience with advanced workflows

## Risk Mitigation

- **Security**: Implement auth before any file operations
- **Performance**: Add rate limiting early
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling from start
- **Scalability**: Design for multi-user from beginning

## Definition of Done

Each TODO is complete when:
- Code is implemented and reviewed
- Unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- Documentation is updated
- Integration tests pass
- Security review completed
- Performance benchmarks met
